There is evidence that magnetic fields play a crucial role in this context. We aim to understand how magnetic fields influence the properties and kinematics of an isolated filament located east of the Barnard 59 clump, belonging to the Pipe Nebula. We use near infrared polarization observations to determine the magnetic field configuration, and we apply the Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method to infer the magnetic field strength in the plane of the sky. Furthermore, we use complementary data from the James Clerk Maxwell Submillimetre Telescope (JCMT) of C18O and 13CO J=3-2 transition to determine the filament's kinematics. Finally, we model the radial density profile of the filament with polytropic cylindrical models. Our results indicate that the filament is stable to radial collapse and is radially supported by agents other than thermal pressure. In addition, based on previous observations of emission lines on this source, we suggest that gas is flowing toward the hub, while C18O (3-2) non-thermal motions indicate that the cloud is in a quiescent state."}

Our metal-poor Sgr population has a larger velocity dispersion than metal-rich Sgr from the literature, which could be explained by outside-in star formation, extreme Galactic tidal perturbations and/or the presence of a metal-rich disc/bar $+$ a metal-poor halo. The average carbon abundance in Sgr is similar to that of other classical dwarf galaxies (DGs) and consistently lower than in the Milky Way by $\\sim0.2-0.3$~dex at low metallicity. The interstellar medium in DGs, including Sgr, may have retained yields from more energetic Pop III and II SNe, thereby reducing the average [C/Fe]. Additionally, SNe~Ia, producing more Fe than C, would start to contribute at lower metallicity in DGs/Sgr than in the Galaxy. The presence of a [C/Fe] gradient for Sgr stars with [Fe/H]~$\\gtrsim-2.0$ ($\\sim 6.8\\times 10^{-4}$ dex arcmin$^{-1}$) suggests that SNe~Ia contributed in the system at those metallicities, especially in its inner regions. There is a low frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Sgr sample. At higher metallicity/carbon abundance (mostly CEMP-s) this may be due to photometric selection effects, but those are less likely to affect CEMP-no stars. We propose that, given the lower average [C/Fe] in DGs, using the same CEMP definition ([C/Fe]~$>+0.7$) as in the Galaxy under-predicts the number of CEMP stars in DGs, and for Sgr a cut at [C/Fe]$~\\sim +0.35$ may be more appropriate, which brings the frequency of CEMP stars in agreement with that in the Galaxy."}

The source was observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST in June 2023 at a MIR luminosity L(MIR)~10^{36} erg/s exceeding past IR levels by about a factor of 10. By contrast, the X-ray flux is much fainter than the historical average, in the source's now-persistent 'obscured' state. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum shows a plethora of emission lines, the strongest of which are consistent with recombination in the hydrogen Pfund (Pf) series and higher. Low amplitude (~1%) but highly significant peak-to-peak photometric variability is found on timescales of ~1,000 s. The brightest Pf(6-5) emission line lags the continuum. Though difficult to constrain accurately, this lag is commensurate with light-travel timescales across the outer accretion disc or with expected recombination timescales inferred from emission line diagnostics. Using the emission line as a bolometric indicator suggests a moderate (~5-30% Eddington) intrinsic accretion rate. Multiwavelength monitoring shows that JWST caught the source close in-time to unprecedentedly bright MIR and radio long-term flaring. Assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung origin for the MIRI continuum suggests an unsustainably high mass-loss rate during this time unless the wind remains bound, though other possible origins cannot be ruled out. PAH features previously detected with Spitzer are now less clear in the MIRI data, arguing for possible destruction of dust in the interim. These results provide a preview of new parameter space for exploring MIR spectral-timing in XRBs and other variable cosmic sources on rapid timescales."}

To investigate the driving mechanism, we observe a sample of polluted and non-polluted white dwarfs in wide binary systems with main-sequence stars. Using the companion stars' metallicities as a proxy for the white dwarfs' primordial metallicities, we compare the metallicities of polluted and non-polluted systems. Because there is a well-known correlation between giant planet occurrence and higher metallicity (with a stronger correlation for close-in and eccentric planets), these metallicity distributions can be used to probe the role of gas giants in white dwarf accretion. We find that the metallicity distributions of polluted and non-polluted systems are consistent with the hypothesis that both samples have the same underlying metallicity distribution. However, we note that this result is likely biased by several selection effects. Additionally, we find no significant trend between white dwarf accretion rates and metallicity. These findings suggest that giant planets are not the dominant cause of white dwarf accretion events in binary systems."}

The formation and evolution of MBH binaries, and in particular their coalescence timescale, is very relevant for current and future facilities aimed at detecting the gravitational-wave signal produced by the MBH close to coalescence. While most of the studies targeting this process are based on hydrodynamic simulations, the high computational cost makes a complete parameter space exploration prohibitive. Semi-analytic approaches represent a valid alternative, but they require ad-hoc prescriptions for the mass loss of the merging galaxies in minor mergers due to tidal stripping, which is not commonly considered or at most modelled assuming very idealised geometries. In this work, we propose a novel, effective model for the tidal stripping in axisymmetric potentials, to be implemented in semi-analytic models. We validate our semi-analytic approach against N-body simulations considering different galaxy sizes, inclinations, and eccentricities, finding only a moderate dependence on the orbit eccentricity. In particular, we find that, for almost circular orbits, our model mildly overestimates the mass loss, and this is due to the adjustment of the stellar distribution after the mass is removed. Nonetheless, the model exhibits a very good agreement with simulations in all the considered conditions, and thus represents an extremely powerful addition to semi-analytic calculations."}

We observe HIP 29442 with CHEOPS for a total of 9.6 days, which we model jointly with 2 sectors of TESS data to derive planetary radii of $3.410\\pm0.046$, $1.551\\pm0.045$ and $1.538\\pm0.049$ R$_\\oplus$ for planets b, c and d, which orbit HIP 29442 with periods of 13.6, 3.5 and 6.4 days. For planet d, this value deviates by more than 3 sigma from the median value reported in the discovery paper, leading us to conclude that caution is required when using TESS photometry to determine the radii of small planets with low per-transit S/N and large gaps between observations. Given the high precision of these new radii, combining them with published RVs from ESPRESSO and HIRES provides us with ideal conditions to investigate the internal structure and formation pathways of the planets in the system. We introduce the publicly available code plaNETic, a fast and robust neural network-based Bayesian internal structure modelling framework. We then apply hydrodynamic models to explore the upper atmospheric properties of these inferred structures. Finally, we identify planetary system analogues in a synthetic population generated with the Bern model for planet formation and evolution. Based on this analysis, we find that the planets likely formed on opposing sides of the water iceline from a protoplanetary disk with an intermediate solid mass. We finally report that the observed parameters of the HIP 29442 system are compatible with both a scenario where the second peak in the bimodal radius distribution corresponds to sub-Neptunes with a pure H/He envelope as well as a scenario with water-rich sub-Neptunes."}

Numerous studies have been conducted to better characterize the general structure of such relativistic plasmas in isolated systems. However, many pulsars are found in binary systems and there are currently no ab initio models available that would include both the pulsar magnetosphere and the wind of the pulsar in interaction with a spherical companion. We investigate the interaction between a pulsar wind and a companion to probe the rearrangement of the pulsar wind, assess whether it leads to an enhancement of particle acceleration, and predict the high-energy radiative signature that stems from this interaction. We perform two-dimensional equatorial particle-in-cell simulations of an inclined pulsar surrounded by a spherical, unmagnetized, perfectly conducting companion settled in its wind. We find that the presence of the companion significantly alters the structure of the wind. When the companion lies beyond the fast magnetosonic point, a shock is established and the perturbations are advected in a cone behind the companion. We observe an enhancement of particle acceleration due to forced reconnection as the current sheet reaches the companion surface. Hence, high-energy synchrotron radiation is also amplified. The orbital light curves display two broad peaks reaching up to 14 times the high-energy pulsed flux emitted by an isolated pulsar magnetosphere. These effects increase with the growth of the companion size and with the decrease of the pulsar-companion separation. The present study suggests that a pulsar wind interacting with a companion induces a significant enhancement of high-energy radiation that takes the form of an orbital-modulated hollow cone of emission, which should be detectable by galactic-plane surveys, possibly with long-period radio transient counterparts."}

Six probable AGB stars and all but one red clump star have only Li upper limits. A rapidly rotating red giant is identified as a possible Li-rich giant, assuming it is a red clump star. Main sequence turnoff stars have a well-defined A(Li) = 2.83 +/- 0.03 (sem) down to the Li-dip wall at the predicted mass of 1.29 solar masses. Despite the same isochronal age as the more metal-rich NGC 2506, the red giant luminosity distribution reflects a younger morphology similar to NGC 7789, possibly indicating a deeper metallicity impact on stellar structure and A(Li) than previously assumed. As in NGC 2506 and NGC 7789, the NGC 2204 turnoff exhibits a broad range of rotation speeds, making abundance estimation impossible for some stars. The cluster place within Galactic A(Li) evolution is discussed."}

A semi-analytic generalized model is formulated to examine the collective effects of polarization force, Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity, and non-thermal (r, q)-distributed electrons on the stability of the PMGC concurrently. The ions are treated with the help of the Maxwellian thermo-statistical distribution law whereas the electrons are modelled with the non-thermal (r, q)-distribution law. The dust species including neutral and negatively charged particles are treated as fluids. A spherical normal mode analysis obtains a quartic linear dispersion relation for the PMGC. The oscillatory and propagation characteristics of the PMGC mode dynamics are investigated on a constructed numerical platform. It found that an increase in the polarization force and positive EiBI parameter significantly enhances the instability resulting in the DMC collapse, and vice versa. The electron non-thermality spectral parameters play a vital role as stabilizing factor. Its reliability and applicability are finally outlined in light of the previous astronomical studies in the same thematic direction."}

The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium (IGM) that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that: (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10-15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, >80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of HeII until z~2.8-3.0, in agreement with observations of the HeII Lyman-alpha forest. In our fiducial models: 1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z~5.3-5.5, and reaches its midpoint at z~6.5-6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ~0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background."}

Open clusters that emerged from the star forming regions as gravitationally bound structures are subjected to star evaporation, ejection, and tidal forces throughout the rest of their lives. Consequently they form tidal tails that can stretch kiloparsecs along the cluster's orbit. Aims. Cluster members are typically found by searching for overdensities in some parameter space (positions and velocities or sometimes actions and orbital parameters of stars). However, this method is not effective in identifying stars located in the tidal tails far from the open cluster cores. We present a probabilistic method for finding distant cluster members without relying on searching for overdensities and apply it to 476 open clusters. Methods. First, we simulate the dissolution of a cluster and obtain a probability distribution (likelihood) describing where cluster members are to be found. The distribution of stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue in high likelihood regions is then compared to the simulated stellar population of the Galaxy to define the membership probability of each star. Results. The survey of cluster members included all stars with a magnitude of G < 17.5 and larger clusters with an age of > 100 Myr within 3 kpc from the Sun. We successfully find stars with high membership probabilities in the tidal tails of most clusters, stretching more than a kiloparsec from the cluster cores in some cases. We analyse the morphological properties of tidal tails, demonstrate how properly normalised membership probabilities aid systematic studies of open clusters and publish a catalogue of stars found in the tidal tails."}

When the planet's orbit is aligned with the equatorial plane of the disc, the eccentricity increases to high values of 0.7-0.9 due to the resonant interaction with the inner parts of the disc. For planets on inclined orbits, the eccentricity increases due to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism, where the disc acts as an external massive body that perturbs the planet's orbit. At small inclination angles, < 30 degrees, the resonant interaction with the inner disc strongly contributes to the eccentricity growth, while at larger angles, eccentricity growth is mainly due to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. We conclude that planets inside low-density cavities tend to acquire high eccentricity if favorable conditions give sufficient time for growth. The final value of the planet's eccentricity, after the disc dispersal depends on the planet's mass and properties of the cavity and protoplanetary disc."}

A dichotomy emerges in the dynamics dissipation behaviors.

Like many dynamically unrelaxed systems, it hosts diffuse radio emission on Mpc-scales. Extended synchrotron sources in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are commonly interpreted as evidence that a fraction of the gravitational energy released during cluster mergers is dissipated into non-thermal components. Here, we use new MeerKAT UHF- and L-band observations to study non-thermal phenomena in Abell 754. These data are complemented with archival XMM-Newton observations to investigate the resolved spectral properties of both the radio and X-ray cluster emission. For the first time, we employed the pipeline originally developed to calibrate LOFAR data to MeerKAT observations. This allowed us to perform a direction-dependent calibration and obtain highly sensitive radio images in UHF- and L-bands which capture the extended emission with unprecedented detail. By using a large XMM-Newton mosaic, we produced thermodynamic maps of the ICM. Our analysis reveals that the radio halo in the cluster center is bounded by the well-known shock in the eastern direction. Furthermore, in the south-west periphery, we discover an extended radio source that we classify as a radio relic which is possibly tracing a shock driven by the squeezed gas compressed by the merger, outflowing in perpendicular directions. The low-luminosity of this relic appears compatible with direct acceleration of thermal pool electrons. We interpreted the observed radio and X-ray features in the context of a major cluster merger with a non-zero impact parameter. Abell 754 is a remarkable galaxy cluster showcasing exceptional features associated with the ongoing merger event. The high quality of the new MeerKAT data motivates further work on this system."}

Based on the Gaia DR3, we reconstructed the orbital evolution of the known Milky Way globular clusters and found that six objects, NGC 6681, NGC 6981, Palomar 6, NGC 6642, HP 1, and NGC 1904, very likely interact closely with the nuclear star cluster. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of selected Milky Way globular clusters and their interactions with the Galactic centre over cosmological timescales. We examine the global dynamical mass loss of these globular cluster systems, their close interactions with the Galactic centre, and the potential capture of stars by the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. Methods. For the dynamical modelling of the clusters, we used the parallel N-body code phi-GPU, which allows star-by-star simulations of the systems. Our current code also enabled us to follow the stellar evolution of individual particles, including the formation of high-mass remnants. The modelling was carried out in a Milky Way-like, time-variable potential (with a dynamically changing mass and scale length), obtained from the IllustrisTNG-100 database, with a full integration time of eight billion years. Results. Based on extensive numerical modelling and analysis, we estimated the mass loss and the global and inner structures of the selected six clusters. Over an evolution of eight billion years, the clusters lost 80% of their initial mass. We analysed the phase-space evolution of the individual unbound stars NGC 6681, NGC 6642, HP 1, and NGC 1904. We found that only NGC 6642 could potentially have been a source for populating the Milky Way nuclear star cluster in the past."}

We defined a controlled, unbiased sample of 36 sub-Neptunes characterised by Kepler, TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of $0.002_{-0.001}^{+0.010}$) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth."}

Here, we introduce a physically-motivated model for the CIB emission spanning a wide range of frequency and angular resolution, employing a halo model approach and distinguishing, within dark matter halos, between two main populations of star forming galaxies, i.e. normal late-type spiral and irregular galaxies and the progenitors of early-type galaxies. The emission from two galaxy populations maps into different regimes in frequency/resolution space, allowing us to constrain the clustering parameters of the model - $M_{\\text{min}}$, the mass of a halo with 50% probability of having a central galaxy and $\\alpha$, the power law index regulating the number of satellite galaxies - through a fit to Planck and Herschel-SPIRE CIB anisotropy measurements. We find that, while being able to place constraints on some of the clustering parameters, the Planck frequency and multipole coverage cannot effectively disentangle the contributions from the two galaxy populations. On the other side, the Herschel-SPIRE measurements separate out and constrain the clustering of both populations.

We compare our computed value to the latest experimental data available from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and find that our binding energy value agrees well with data obtained from binding to either crystalline or amorphous ice. Importantly, our new value is lower than that used in most astrochemical networks by about nearly half its value. We explore the impact of this revised binding energy value for both an AGB outflow and a protoplanetary disk. We find that the lower value of the binding energy predicted here compared with values used in the literature (4050 K versus 7587 K) leads to less depletion of gas-phase benzene in an AGB outflow, and leads to a shift outwards in the benzene snowline in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. Using this new value, the AGB model predicts lower abundances of benzene in the solid phase throughout the outflow. The disk model also predicts a larger reservoir of gas-phase benzene in the inner disk, which is consistent with the recent detections of benzene for the first time in protoplanetary disks with JWST."}

SpUpNIC is a general purpose 2 arc-minute long-slit spectrograph with a grating suite covering the wavelength range from 350 to 1000 nm and at spectral resolutions between 500 and 6000. FiberPol generates 6D observational data: x-y spatial dimensions, wavelength, and the three linear Stokes parameters $I$, $q$ and $u$. Using a rotating half-wave plate and a Wollaston prism, FiberPol executes two-channel polarimetry, and each channel is fed to an array of 14 fibers, corresponding to a field of view of $10\\times20~arcseconds^2$ sampled with 2.9 arcsecond diameter fiber cores. These fiber arrays are then rerouted to form a pseudo-slit input to SpUpNIC. FiberPol aims to achieve a polarimetric accuracy of 0.1 % per spectral resolution bin. Further, it can also function as a non-polarimetric integral-field unit. The instrument design has been completed and it is currently being assembled and characterized in the lab. It is scheduled for on-sky commissioning in the second half of 2024. In this paper, we present the scientific and technical goals of FiberPol, its overall design and initial results from the lab assembly and testing.

Using spectra from the Gaia-ESO archives, we find that the stars in the red part of the eMSTO have a higher mean v sin i value of 135.3$\\pm$4.6 km s$^{-1}$ compared to the stars in the blue part that have an average v sin i equal to 81.3$\\pm$5.6 km s$^{-1}$.

We do not find any substantial evidence of the dust-like extinction from the eMSTO stars using ultraviolet data from the Swift survey. The estimated synchronization time for low mass ratio close binaries in the blue part of the eMSTO suggests that they would be mostly slow-rotating if present. However, the stars in the blue part of the eMSTO are preferentially located in the outer region of the cluster indicating that they may lack low mass ratio close binaries. The spread in rotation rates of eMSTO stars in NGC 2355 is most likely caused by the star-disc interaction mechanism. The stars in the lower main sequence beyond the eMSTO region of NGC 2355 are slow-rotating (mean v sin i = 26.5$\\pm$1.3 km s$^{-1}$) possibly due to the magnetic braking of their rotations."}

Simulations with comoving volumes of 40^3 h^-3 cMpc^3 (160^3 h^-3 cMpc^3), calibrated to match the observed Lyman-alpha forest transmission with a late end to reionisation at z<6, are consistent with recent mean free path measurements at z<5.9, and are 1.2\\sigma (1.8\\sigma) above the highest redshift mean free path measurement at z=5.93.

Resolving these systems is critical for capturing the redshift evolution of the mean free path during the final stages of reionisation. After reionisation completes, overdense gas will reduce the mean free path by up to 20 per cent around haloes with masses M_h ~ 10^9--10^11 h^-1 M_sol, but during reionisation ionised bubbles will instead boost the mean free path around haloes by up to an order of magnitude when the IGM is as much as 90 per cent neutral by volume.

We focus on the properties of the source spectrum and composition required to reproduce the observations, showing that the nuclei are strongly suppressed for E>10Z EeV, either by a rigidity dependent source cutoff or by the photodisintegration interactions with the CMB at the giant dipole resonance. The very mild attenuation effects at lower energies imply that the secondary nuclei from this source only provide a small contribution. Given the moderate anisotropies observed, the deflections in extragalactic and Galactic magnetic fields should play a crucial role in determining the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution. The diffusion in extragalactic fields as well as the finite source lifetime also significantly affect the shape of the observed spectrum. The cosmic ray flux at tens of EeV is dominated by the CNO component, and we show that it is actually better reproduced by a mixture of C and O nuclei rather than by the usual assumption of a N component effectively describing this mass group. The Si and Fe group components become dominant above 70 EeV, in the energy range in which a strong spectral suppression is present. If the localised flux excess appearing above 40 EeV around the Centaurus A direction is attributed to the CNO component, the He nuclei from the source in the energy range from 10 to 20 EeV could lead to a similar anisotropy unless its contribution is suppressed. The cosmic ray flux at a few EeV should mostly result from a more isotropic light component associated to a population of extragalactic sources. The inclusion of the subdominant contribution of heavy nuclei from the Galactic component helps to reproduce the observations around 1 EeV."}

The present plasma is divided into a central part and very long tail, where the central part of the plasma shows an exponential dependence on the distance from the galaxy center, but a part of the large mass of this plasma is included in the long stellar plasma tail. The present model is specialized to completely ionized Hydrogen plasma (with a small correction factor considering its mixture with heavier atoms) where emission and absorption of spectral lines can be neglected in the warm low density stellar plasma. We apply the present approach for treating rotation curves measurements, A general theory for rotation curves should include the superposition of the gravitational potentials introduced by the high-density compact stars, with those of the low-density stellar plasma potentials. But for halos which are at extremely large distance from the galaxy center, the dominant effects would be those of dark matter, and such dark halos are permeating and surrounding the compact galactic stars. Such plasma is found to be transparent in most of the EM spectrum. The existence of a large mass for the warm low-density plasma may solve the problem of missing mass in rotation curves measurements."}

We have detected gamma-ray emission at a significant level exceeding 8 {\\sigma} in daily bins starting the day after the optical eruption. The gamma-ray emission, characterized by a Test Statistic (TS) value more than four, persisted for approximately 40 days. Notably, harder X-ray emission were observed by NuSTAR as the start of gamma-ray emission, which is the fourth classical nova that gamma-ray emission is concurrent with harder X-ray emission from NuSTAR data. V1716 Sco is one of rare samples that clearly shows a hard X-ray emission (1-10 keV bands) in the Swift-XRT data concurrently with gamma-ray emission of Fermi-LAT data, and its light curve in 1.0-10.0 keV bands had a peak at about 20 days after the optical eruption. The X-ray spectrum was initially fitted by a model of thermal plasma emission, and entered a supersoft phase with additional blackbody (BB) component emerged around about 40 days after the optical eruption. NICER data taken in supersoft source phase revealed a quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 79.10+-1.98 seconds, and the peak phase of the folded light curve varied with time. Moreover, V1716 Sco is the another example that the emission radius in supersoft source phase is significantly larger than the radius of white dwarf, and a simple BB emission model may not be applicable since the luminosity exceeds significantly Eddington limit."}

Our observations reveal intricate structures seen in a major merger akin to the Bullet Cluster. The X-ray data confirm the existence of two shock fronts, one to the northwest and one to the southeast by directly measuring the temperature jump of gas across the surface brightness edges. The stronger shock front in the northwest has a density jump of $3.16 \\pm 0.34$ across the sharp surface brightness edge and Mach number $M = 3.36^{+0.87}_{-0.48}$, which makes this cluster one of the rare merging systems with a Mach number $M > 2$. We use the northwestern shock to compare two models for shock heating - the instant heating model and the Coulomb collisional heating model, and we determine that the temperatures across the shock front agree with the Coulomb collisional model of heating. For the shock front in the southeastern region, we find a density jump of $1.53 \\pm 0.14$ and a Mach number of $M = 1.36 ^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$."}

However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S_8$ tension."}

The method is based on comparison of the energy-dependent distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions as measured by the Telescope Array experiment (TA) with that calculated in a given putative model of UHECR under the assumption that sources trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. As we report in the companion letter, the TA data show large deflections with respect to the LSS which can be explained, assuming small extra-galactic magnetic fields (EGMF), by an intermediate composition changing to a heavy one (iron) in the highest energy bin. Here we show that these results are robust to uncertainties in UHECR injection spectra, the energy scale of the experiment and galactic magnetic fields (GMF). The assumption of weak EGMF, however, strongly affects this interpretation at all but the highest energies E > 100 EeV, where the remarkable isotropy of the data implies a heavy injected composition even in the case of strong EGMF. This result also holds if UHECR sources are as rare as $2 \\times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, that is the conservative lower limit for the source number density."}

The composition is inferred from an energy-dependent sky distribution of UHECR events observed by the Telescope Array surface detector by comparing it to the Large Scale Structure of the local Universe. In the case of negligible extra-galactic magnetic fields the results are consistent with a relatively heavy injected composition at E ~ 10 EeV that becomes lighter up to E ~ 100 EeV, while the composition at E > 100 EeV is very heavy. The latter is true even in the presence of highest experimentally allowed extra-galactic magnetic fields, while the composition at lower energies can be light if a strong EGMF is present.

M31 hosts the largest supermassive black hole (SMBH) closer than 1 Mpc from us. Its nucleus is silent with some murmurs at the level of 4 10$^{-9}$ L$_{Edd}$, and is surrounded by a 5-pc-radius disk of old stars. The mass-loss from these stars is expected to fill a molecular gas disk within the tidal truncation of 1 pc (0.26\"), of 10$^4$ Mo, corresponding to a CO(1-0) signal of 2mJy with a linewidth of 1000km/s. We observed the nucleus with NOEMA in CO(2-1) and with ALMA in CO(3-2) with angular resolutions of 0.5\" (1.9 pc) and 0.12\" (0.46 pc) respectively. We exclude the presence of gas with a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of 195 Mo. The CO(3-2) upper limit also constrains warm gas, escaping detection in CO(1-0). The scenario proposed by Chang et al. is not verified, and instead the hot gas, expelled by the stellar winds, might never cool nor fall onto the disc. Alternatively, the stellar wind mass-loss rate can have been overestimated by a factor 50, and/or the ionised gas escaped from the nucleus. The SMBH in M31 is obviously in a low state of activity, similar to what is observed for Sgr A* in the Milky Way (MW). Recently, a cool (10$^4$ K) ionised accretion disc has been detected around Sgr A* in the H30$\\alpha$ recombination line with ALMA. Re-scaling sizes, masses and fluxes according to the mass of M31's black hole (35 times higher than in the MW) and the distances, a similar disc could be easily detectable around M31 nucleus with an expected signal 8 times weaker that the signal detected in SgrA*. We searched for an ionised gas disc around M31 nucleus with NOEMA, and put a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the H30$\\alpha$ recombination line at a level twice lower than expected with a simple scaling of the SgrA*."}

This is \"Vector Resonant Relaxation\", a diffusion process formally occurring on the unit sphere. Such a dynamics is intrinsically non-linear, stochastic, and correlated, hence bearing deep similarities with turbulence in fluid mechanics or plasma physics. In that context, we show how generic methods stemming from statistical closure theory, namely the celebrated \"Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism\", can be used to characterize the correlations describing the redistribution of orbital orientations. In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called \"Direct Interaction Approximation\", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues."}

The requirement of highly deuteron-abundant sources imposes a serious challenge on the modern astrophysics since there is no known process to produce a large amount of deuterons without violating other constraints \\cite{1976Natur.263..198E}. In this work we demonstrate that the fragmentation of heavy nuclei up to iron plays a crucial role in shaping/enhancing the spectrum/flux of the cosmic ray deuterons. Based on the latest cosmic ray data, the predicted secondary fluxes of deuterons and $^3$He are found to be reasonably consistent with the AMS-02 measurements and a primary deuteron component is not needed. The apparent difference between D/$^4$He (D/p) and $^3$He/$^4$He ($^3$He/p) is probably due to a combined effect of the kinetic-energy-to-rigidity conversion and the solar modulation. More precise measurements of the fragmentation cross sections of various nuclei to produce deuterons, tritons, and $^3$He in a wide energy range will be very helpful in further testing the secondary origin of cosmic ray deuterons."}

Here we report observations by the Lucy spacecraft as it passed within 431 km of Dinkinesh. Lucy revealed Dinkinesh, which has an effective diameter of only $\\sim$720 m, to be unexpectedly complex. Of particular note is the presence of a prominent longitudinal trough overlain by a substantial equatorial ridge, and the discovery of the first confirmed contact binary satellite, now named (152830) Dinkinesh I Selam. Selam consists of two near-equal sized lobes with diameters of $\\sim$210 m and $\\sim$230 m. It orbits Dinkinesh at a distance of 3.1 km with an orbital period of about 52.7 hr, and is tidally locked. The dynamical state, angular momentum, and geomorphologic observations of the system lead us to infer that the ridge and trough of Dinkinesh are probably the result of mass failure resulting from spin-up by YORP followed by the partial reaccretion of the shed material. Selam probably accreted from material shed by this event."}

By seamlessly integrating Bayesian statistics and variational methods our model effectively minimizes foreground contamination in the observed CMB maps. The model is trained using foreground and noise contaminated CMB temperature maps simulated at Planck LFI and HFI frequency channels 30 - 353 GHz using publicly available Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) and Python Sky Model (PySM) packages. During training, our model transforms initial prior distribution on the model parameters to posterior distributions based on the training data. From the joint full posterior of the model parameters, during inference, a predicitve CMB posterior and summary statistics such as the predictive mean, variance etc of the cleaned CMB map is estimated. The predictive standard deviation map provides a direct and interpretable measure of uncertainty per pixel in the predicted mean CMB map. The cleaned CMB map along with the error estimates can be used for more accurate measurements of cosmological parameters and other cosmological analyses."}

We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and lower amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. B-sequence SARGs yield both the most precise and the brightest tip magnitude, and they are best suited for distance determination and Hubble constant measurements because they correspond to the oldest stars near TRGB. Assuming the geometric distance measured by detached eclipsing binaries, the B-sequence yields the SMC's most accurate TRGB calibration to date: M_{F814W,syn} = -4.057 \\pm 0.019(stat.) \\pm 0.029(syst.) mag (1.5% in distance).

Radiative processes are fundamentally stochastic in nature, and the best tools currently used for resolving these processes computationally are Monte Carlo (MC) methods. These methods typically draw a large number of samples from a complex distribution such as the differential cross section for electron-photon scattering, and then use these samples to compute the radiation properties such as angular distribution, spectrum, and polarization. In this work we propose a machine learning (ML) technique for efficient sampling from arbitrary known probability distributions that can be used to accelerate Monte Carlo calculation of radiative processes in astrophysical scenarios. In particular, we apply our technique to inverse Compton radiation and find that our ML method can be up to an order of magnitude faster than traditional methods currently in use."}
